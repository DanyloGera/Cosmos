    <p class="card-text"><br>Cigar Galaxy</br>
Initially, M82 was considered an irregular galaxy. However, in 2005, images of the galaxy in the near-IR range (after subtracting the radiation of the symmetric exponential disk) revealed two symmetrical spiral arms. They both start at the ends of the bar and extend to about three characteristic disc sizes. Despite the fact that the sleeves were open in the near infrared, they are more blue in color than the disk itself. Assuming that the northern part of the M82 is closer to us (as considered in most literature), the observed direction of rotation implies lagging spiral arms. The spiral structure could not be considered before due to the high brightness of the M82 disk, the orientation at a large angle (~ 80 Â°) to the terrestrial observer, as well as the presence of a complex grid of dust formations in images in visible light.</p>

 <p class="card-text"><br>Andromeda Galaxy.</br>
The Andromeda Galaxy, like the Milky Way, belongs to the Local Group and moves towards the Sun at a speed of 300 km / s. Thus, it belongs to the objects that have a blue offset. Having determined the direction and speed of the Sun's motion in the Milky Way, astronomers found that the Andromeda Galaxy was approaching the Milky Way at a speed of 100-140 km / s. Accordingly, the collision of two galactic systems will occur in about 3-4 billion years. If that happens, they are likely to merge into one large galaxy. It is possible that the solar system will be ejected into intergalactic space by powerful gravitational perturbations. However, the Sun and the planets will most likely not be destroyed in this catastrophic process.</p>

<p class="card-text"><br>Sleeping Beauty Galaxy.</br>
The peculiarity of this object is its origin from two sticky galaxies with different directions of rotation. As a result, the gas-dust disk in the inner part of the object rotates in the opposite direction relative to the rotation of the stars and gas on its periphery. This object is among those listed in the original version of the new general catalog. M64 due to such a wonderful feature of appearance - a popular object for amateur observations. The best time for observations is from the end of winter to the beginning of summer. In the amateur telescope, an elongated elliptical shape of the galaxy and a bright almost star-shaped nucleus are first noted. At night (without artificial and natural illumination) at a telescope aperture of 200-300 mm, on closer inspection to the northeast of the nucleus, the formation that gave the object its name is clearly visible.</p>
